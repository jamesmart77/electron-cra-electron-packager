# Electron For Life
Very simple app built with [Electron](https://electronjs.org/) to show how simple it is to build cross-platform desktop applications with notifications. 

I mostly followed this tutorial - [HERE](https://www.npmjs.com/package/electron-builder)

## Setup
1. `npm install`
2. `npm run electron-dev`

## Packaging
1. To create a package for a Windows device on a Mac OS, make sure you have `wine` installed on your machine (`brew install wine`)
